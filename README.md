# Virtual-Classroom-Attendance
This is a project based on relieving the organisation from cumbersome process of manual attendance maintainence procedure.
app.py consists of the open-cv based program file which generates necessary image construction required for face-recognition module to work.
which then is converted to a simple csv based document with timestamps of generation from webcam.
